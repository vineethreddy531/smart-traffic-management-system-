#  Smart Traffic Management System

A Python-based project that aims to **optimize traffic signals dynamically** using real‚Äëtime inputs (e.g., camera/sensor counts), with the goal of reducing congestion, wait time, and emissions.

##   Overview

Modern cities face heavy congestion and unpredictable traffic patterns. This project demonstrates an **adaptive signal controller** that changes green/red durations based on observed traffic density, with optional support for (a) **emergency vehicle priority**, (b) **manual override**, and (c) **data logging** for later analysis.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Adaptive signal timing** based on vehicle counts/queue lengths.
* **Configurable phases & thresholds** (min/max green, inter‚Äëgreen safety, cycle length, etc.).
* **(Optional) Emergency priority**: pre‚Äëempt signals when an ambulance/fire/Police vehicle is detected.
* **(Optional) Camera or sensor input**: works with vision (webcam/CCTV) or IR/ultrasonic loops.
* **(Optional) Dashboard/CLI logs**: monitor current state, phase times, and counts.

> Tip: If your implementation is software‚Äëonly (simulation), keep the **camera/sensor** items optional in requirements. If you‚Äôve built a physical prototype, add your wiring diagram and pin map.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python 3.8+
* **Packages (choose what applies)**:

  * `opencv-python` (camera input + basic detection/ROI counting)
  * `numpy`, `imutils`
  * `flask`/**`fastapi`** (if you expose a simple web API/UI)
  * `RPi.GPIO`/`gpiozero` (if running on Raspberry Pi with LEDs/relays)
  * `pandas`, `matplotlib` (for logs/analysis)


!!   How It Works (Typical Pipeline)

1. **Input**: read camera or sensor signals for each approach/road.
2. **Counting**: estimate vehicles (e.g., basic background subtraction, motion ROI, or classical detection).
3. **Decision**: compute next phase and duration using density/queue lengths bounded by min/max constraints.
4. **Switching**: set the current green, handle **yellow** and **all‚Äëred** safety intervals, then move to the next phase.
5. **(Optional) Priority**: if emergency detected, pre‚Äëempt current cycle to give right‚Äëof‚Äëway.
6. **(Optional) Log/visualize**: stream to console, CSV, or a local dashboard.

> If you use computer vision (OpenCV), document your **camera index**, **frame size**, and **ROIs** for counting.

##  Screenshots / Demo

Add any of the following to this section:

* A screenshot of your console or UI.
* A short GIF/video of the simulation/prototype.
* A wiring photo for hardware builds (LEDs, relays, Pi, etc.).

##  Configuration

Create a simple config (flags or a `config.py`) for parameters like:

* `LANES = ["N", "E", "S", "W"]`
* `MIN_GREEN, MAX_GREEN, YELLOW, ALL_RED`
* Detection thresholds (ROI polygons, pixel area cut‚Äëoffs)
* Camera index / stream URL
* GPIO pin mapping (if physical prototype)

---

##  Troubleshooting

* **Black/blank camera window** ‚Üí Check the correct camera index/stream URL and permissions.
* **OpenCV import error** ‚Üí Ensure the correct wheels are installed for your Python version/OS. Try `pip install --upgrade pip` then reinstall.
* **GPIO not found** ‚Üí Only required on Raspberry Pi; skip on Windows/macOS.
* **Long green times** ‚Üí Verify that your counting isn‚Äôt over‚Äëcounting; adjust ROI or detection threshold.

---

##  Roadmap / Future Work

* Replace classical detection with **deep learning** (YOLOv8/YOLO‚ÄëNAS) for robust counts.
* **Multi‚Äëjunction coordination** (network‚Äëlevel optimization).
* Real‚Äëtime **web dashboard** (FastAPI + WebSocket + lightweight frontend).
* **Data storage** & analytics (SQLite/CSV ‚Üí dashboards).
* **Vehicle class weighting** (give more weight to public transport/emergency vehicles).
